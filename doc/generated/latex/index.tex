Gamesman is a system developed for solving, playing and analyzing two-\/person, abstract strategy games (e.\+g., Tic-\/\+Tac-\/\+Toe, or Chess). Given the description of a game as input, our system generates a text-\/based and Tcl/\+Tk graphical application that will solve it (in the strong sense), and then play it perfectly. Programmers can easily prototype a new game with multiple rule variants, learn the strategy via color-\/coded moves, and perform extended analysis. Since its inception, more than sixty-\/eight games have been integrated into the system by over five hundred undergraduates, with still more in development.\hypertarget{index_Example}{}\doxysection{Fancy Stuff}\label{index_Example}
