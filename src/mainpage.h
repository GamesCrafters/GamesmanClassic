 * @section Introduction
 * 
 * Gamesman is a system developed for solving, playing and analyzing two-person, abstract strategy games (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, or Chess). Given the description of a game as input, our system generates a text-based and Tcl/Tk graphical application that will solve it (in the strong sense), and then play it perfectly. Programmers can easily prototype a new game with multiple rule variants, learn the strategy via color-coded moves, and perform extended analysis. Since its inception, more than sixty-eight games have been integrated into the system by over five hundred undergraduates, with still more in development.
